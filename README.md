# habitist [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/amitness/habitist/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/amitness/habitist)
An automation to enable habit tracking in todoist.

It integrates Seinfield's "[Don't Break the Chain](https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)" method into [todoist](http://todoist.com/). Once it's setup, you can forget about it and it works seamlessly.

## Usage

![Habitist Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/q4h2QGv.png)

1. You add habits you want to form as task on todoist with schedule `every day`

2. Add `[day 0]` to the task

3. When you complete the task, the [day 0] will become [day 1]

4. If you fail to complete the task and it becomes overdue, the script will schedule it to today and reset [day X] to [day 0].
